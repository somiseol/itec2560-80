"Property ... was accessed during render but is not defined on instance"

What does this Vue warning message mean?
    Vue cannot find Property in component's state

Can you safely ignore it?
    Should not be ignored.

What causes it, and how do you fix it? 
    Using a property not defined in the code
    Fixed by correcting typo, correcting scope, defining function, creating the computed property, etc
